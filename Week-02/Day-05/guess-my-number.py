# Write a program where the program chooses a number between 1 and 100. The player is then asked to enter a guess. If the player guesses wrong, then the program gives feedback and ask to enter an other guess until the guess is correct.

# Make the range customizable (ask for it before starting the guessing).
# You can add lives. (optional)
